##Swords of Turing
https://github.com/Marly1995/beta-game

Swords of Turing is a two player sword fighting combat game created by a group of university
students. This game features a simple yet intuitive control system in which the attacks and the defences
can have directional inputs as well, meaning it takes more skill to block an attack or to land an attack correctly
onto your opponent.
